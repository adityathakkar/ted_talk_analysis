Statistical analysis and topic clustering of Ted Talks 

The 'Ted_Talks' python notebook looks at a simple statistical analysis of the different properties of the Ted Talk data, to try and gain insights. The TED_NLP_Clustering notebook groups the Ted Talks together using a clustering based system, to try and understand what topics yeild the greatest number of views. Slides for the details of the method are also attached as a PDF (not mine).
